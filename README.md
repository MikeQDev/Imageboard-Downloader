"An imageboard or image board is a type of Internet forum which operates mostly via posting images." --Wikipedia

This program is coded in 100% in Java and uses no external libraries.

Created for a friend of mine who wanted to be able to quickly - and automatically - save all of the images that were posted in a specific imageboard's thread. In the posted screenshots of the program, I demonstrated downloading wallpapers from a wallpaper thread.


##Using this program##

The .webm checkbox gives to user the option of either downloading or ignoring .webm filetypes which are video files and have slightly larger filesizes than images.

The 'Threads' spinner box allows the program to use multithreading - NOT download multiple imageboard threads at once.

There is no button to select the save destination, but clicking on the textfield opens up a file dialog box which allows the user to chose a directory to save the downloaded images.



##Additional ideas for this program:##

<s>Adding an option that auto-refreshs the imageboard thread so that newly posted images will automatically download on autopilot (or when the user if AFK)</s> Added! (in v1.1, v1.2)

<s>Ability to download multiple imageboard threads at once</s> Added (v2)

##V1.1 changes##
<ul>
<li>Added auto-refresh</li>
<li>Cleaned up a lot of code</li>
<li>Made GUI updates more efficient</li>
</ul>

##v1.2 changes##
<ul>
<li>Fixed incorrect progress bar display</li>
</ul>

##v2 changes##
<ul>
<li>GUI changed</li>
<li>Download multiple imageboard threads at once</li>
<li>Removed autorefresh.. Will be added back in next version</li>
</ul>
